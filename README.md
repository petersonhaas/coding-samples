# Coding Samples
This repository includes code examples used in economic research and other personal projects. 

## 1. Economic Outlook (Python, Streamlit, API)
Public Web Application: https://myfedapp.streamlit.app/

This ```Economic_Outlook.py``` Python file runs a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to search for and visualize economic data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API. Users can enter search terms to find economic indicators, filter results by popularity, and select specific data series to analyze. The app retrieves time-series data, processes it into a structured Pandas DataFrame, and provides interactive visualizations using Plotly. Additional features include custom color selection, multiple time range filters, and optional comparison between two indicators. Users can also download the data in CSV format and generated figures. The app offers customization options, such as grid lines, data labels, recession bars, and autoscaling.

## 2. Extract Revisions (Python)
Original Repository: https://github.com/petersonhaas/corporate-profits-and-GDI.git 

The ```Extract_Revisions.ipynb``` Jupyter notebook (Python) is designed to extract key data releases and compute revisions for various economic variables published by the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). These variables were aggregated in historical data through the Real-Time Data Set for Macroeconomists (RTDSM) maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The key variables used are Gross Domestic Income (GDI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Corporate Profits, and GDP Deflator. Details for each variable can be found in the GitHub repository linked above.
